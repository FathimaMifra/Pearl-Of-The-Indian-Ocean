<h1 align="center">Pearl Of The Indian Ocean <br>Responsive Tourist Website Project </h1>

  
### Description 
<p align="justify"> This webpage is for tourists who visit Sri Lanka. This webpage provides the best places in a particular district. I have also included HTML, CSS, Javascript, and VueJS to make this website. Clients can also note the places they wish to visit in the upcoming days. This can be done in a To-Do section, and I have used VueJS. I have added an image for the home background to make the website look realistic. I have added the images for the best places in a particular district. I have also added videos at the end of each district for tourists to learn more about the best places. I have also added a Query using Javascript, which can be useful for tourists to ask for help and send feedback. About Us and Contact Us give information about the website and a way to contact them, respectively.</p>
  
### Problems 
<p align="justify"> We had not learned about VueJS at the time the mini-project was given. It was hard to study VueJS quickly and complete the website. We have been given a VueJS tutorial link on our LMS page, but it was hard to understand that tutorial because of a lack of explanation.</p>
<p align="justify">Since it is my first website, it was hard to design the website </p>
  
### Solution Approach
- W3Schools, YouTube, and Google resources are very useful when I have problems. Itâ€™s a good
solution provider, too.
- We had a workshop at the final time in Vue Js. That workshop was so helpful in completing our mini-project.
- I have looked through some of the YouTube videos on how to make a webpage. Those YouTube videos helped me complete this mini-project.
- We had an extra class with our tutor explaining Vue Js. Those explanations also helped me use VueJS.

### Conclusion
<p align="justify">The purpose and objective of the Pearl of the Indian Ocean project are achieved. By providing an extremely rich graphical user interface, web page design is accessible and aesthetic. Flexibility in designing makes users explore their imagination, and thus, even a novice user can dream and accomplish their wish for web page. </p>
